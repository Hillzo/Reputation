# Reputation Protocol Smart Contract

## About
The Reputation Protocol is a comprehensive Clarity smart contract system for managing, evaluating, and governing participant reputation scores on the Stacks blockchain. It implements a stake-weighted reputation system with temporal decay, evaluator credentialing, and governance mechanisms.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Reputation Management**
  - Dynamic score calculation
  - Weighted evaluation system
  - Temporal decay mechanism
  - Historical tracking

### Economic Model
- **Collateral System**
  - Minimum stake requirements
  - Stake-weighted influence
  - Penalty mechanisms
  - Collateral scaling

### Governance
- **Protocol Administration**
  - Parameter updates
  - Emergency controls
  - Upgradability framework

### Security
- **Access Control**
  - Role-based permissions
  - Evaluator credentials
  - Activity monitoring

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Only authorized evaluators can submit evaluations
- Administrative functions restricted to protocol administrator
- Collateral requirements prevent Sybil attacks

### Economic Security
- Stake-weighted influence limits manipulation
- Temporal decay prevents score stagnation
- Penalty mechanisms discourage malicious behavior

### Best Practices
1. Always verify transaction success
2. Monitor evaluation patterns for manipulation
3. Maintain adequate collateral levels
4. Regular security audits recommended

### Customization
Parameters can be adjusted through governance:
- Reputation bounds
- Collateral requirements
- Epoch timing
- Decay rates

## Error Handling

### Error Codes
- `ERR-ACCESS-DENIED (u100)`: Unauthorized access
- `ERR-VALIDATION-FAILED (u200)`: Input validation failure
- `ERR-ENTITY-NOT-FOUND (u300)`: Entity lookup failure
- `ERR-INSUFFICIENT-FUNDS (u400)`: Economic constraint violation

### Error Recovery
1. Verify transaction parameters
2. Check authorization status
3. Ensure adequate collateral
4. Validate input ranges

### Code Style
- Follow Clarity conventions
- Document public functions
- Include test coverage
- Maintain backwards compatibility
